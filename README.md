# PuzzleSolver

This project will grow into a collection of solvers for a variety of
puzzles as typically found in (British) newspapers, such as crosswords
(both simple and cryptic), Codeword, KenKen, Futoshiki, Kakuro and
sundry varieties of Suduko.

The ultimate aim is to put a newpaper page in front of a camera and
have a robot arm write in the solutions to the puzzles.  That will be
a long time in the future unless additional workers join in.  For the
moment, only a simple crossword of the block and space variety (as
opposed to a bar and space grid) is under development.  Implementing
the numerical and/or combinatorial puzzle solvers should be easier;
cryptic crosswords are likely to be on the research project scale.

A curiosity, perhaps, is that the code is written in Algol 68,
specifically the [Algol 68 Genie](http://jmvdveer.home.xs4all.nl)
implementation of Marcel van der Veer.

Have fun, and try out one of the most beautiful programming languages
ever designed and implemented.
